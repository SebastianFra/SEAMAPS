MEASURES:
Fuel emissions WTT: 
	unit: [ktCO2eq/PJ]
	description: Well-To-Tank fuel emissions upstream emissions
Fuel emissions TWW: 
	unit: [ktCO2eq/PJ]
	description: Tank-to-Wake  fuel emissions
Fuel cost:
	unit:[M€2019/PJ]
	description: fuel costs for each respective fuel on a annual basis
Biomass Availabiltiy
	unit: [PJ]
	description: Availability of sustainable biomass potential for biofuels
	Gap: Here we use averages of sustainable biomass only (Crop Residues, Forestry residues, Black liquor). We could use the MESSAGEix availbility of biomass
Competing Demand:
	unit: [PJ]
	description: demand for biomass from other industries here: aviation, petro-chemical, biomass for electricity, On-Road-Freight
	Gap: Here we use averages from different reports for the respective industries and also only cover a few industries. In this case we should use MESSAGEix to have a more holistic approach to this topic.
